# Popup Debug Guide

## Issue Fixed
The popup on the home page was intermittently working due to several potential issues:
1. **localStorage timing issues** - Race conditions during component mounting
2. **Browser storage limitations** - Incognito mode or disabled localStorage
3. **Image loading failures** - Popup would fail if image couldn't load
4. **Timing conflicts** - Component mounting before proper initialization

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced localStorage Checking
- Added `isLocalStorageAvailable()` function to detect storage availability
- Added fallback behavior when localStorage is unavailable
- Added verification logging for storage operations

### 2. Improved Timing
- Increased delay from 100ms to 500ms for component mounting
- Added proper cleanup for timers
- Enhanced error handling

### 3. Better Modal Implementation
- Added proper event handling to prevent accidental dismissal
- Enhanced z-index and positioning
- Added image loading error handling
- Added smooth animation with `animate-fadeIn` class

### 4. Debug Features (Remove in Production)
- Console logging for all popup operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for testing:
  - `Ctrl + P`: Show popup manually
  - `Ctrl + R`: Reset popup (clear localStorage and show)
- Component lifecycle logging

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Fresh Browser
1. Open browser in incognito/private mode
2. Navigate to home page
3. Popup should appear within 1 second

### Method 2: Clear Storage
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear localStorage for the site
4. Refresh the page
5. Popup should appear

### Method 3: Manual Testing
1. On home page, press `Ctrl + P` to show popup manually
2. Press `Ctrl + R` to reset and show popup
3. Check console for debug messages

### Method 4: Verify localStorage
1. Open Developer Tools console
2. Type: `localStorage.getItem('hasSeenWelcomeModal')`
3. Should return `null` (first visit) or `"true"` (seen before)
4. Type: `localStorage.removeItem('hasSeenWelcomeModal')` to reset
5. Refresh page to see popup again

## Console Messages to Look For
- "HomePage component mounted"
- "Checking localStorage for hasSeenWelcomeModal: [value]"
- "Showing welcome modal" or "User has already seen welcome modal"
- "showWelcomeModal state changed to: true/false"
- "Popup image loaded successfully"
- "Closing welcome modal"
- "Set hasSeenWelcomeModal to true in localStorage"

## Known Behaviors
- Popup shows only once per browser session (unless reset)
- Popup will show as fallback if localStorage is unavailable
- Popup will close if image fails to load
- Popup can be dismissed by clicking backdrop or close button

## Production Cleanup
Before deploying to production, remove:
1. All console.log statements
2. Keyboard event listeners for Ctrl+P and Ctrl+R
3. The `showPopupManually` and `resetPopup` functions
4. This debug file
