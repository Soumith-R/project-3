# Implementation Summary: Email Functionality for Contact Forms

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Backend Email Server (`server.js`)
- **Express.js server** with email functionality using Nodemailer
- **Email endpoint**: `POST /api/send-email` with form source differentiation
- **Rich HTML email templates** with unique styling for each form type:
  - About Us form: Blue theme with "About Us Contact" subject
  - Contact form: Green theme with "Contact Form Submission" subject  
  - Get Involved form: Orange theme with "Get Involved Submission" subject
- **Health check endpoint**: `GET /api/health`
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Gmail integration** with App Password support

### 2. Form Components Updated
- **ContactForm** (`src/components/contact-form.tsx`):
  - Added `source` prop with "contact" default
  - Updated API endpoint to `http://localhost:5000/api/send-email`
  - Includes source in form submission data

- **ContactFormFull** (`src/components/contact-form-full.tsx`):
  - Added `source` prop with "contact" default
  - Updated API endpoint to `http://localhost:5000/api/send-email`
  - Includes source in form submission data

### 3. Page Integration
- **About Us page**: Uses `ContactForm` with `source="about"`
- **Contact page**: Uses `ContactFormFull` with `source="contact"`
- **Get Involved page**: Uses `ContactFormFull` with `source="get-involved"`

### 4. Package Configuration
- **Dependencies added**: express, nodemailer, cors, dotenv, concurrently, node-fetch
- **Scripts added**:
  - `npm run server` - Start backend server
  - `npm run dev:full` - Start both frontend and backend
  - `npm run test:email` - Test email functionality

### 5. Configuration Files
- **`.env`**: Environment variables template with email configuration
- **`EMAIL_SETUP.md`**: Comprehensive setup and configuration guide
- **`test-email.js`**: API testing script for all form types
- **`test-email.bat`**: Windows batch script for easy testing

## üîß NEXT STEPS (For User)

### 1. Configure Email Credentials
Edit `.env` file with your actual credentials:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password  # Not regular password!
ORGANIZATION_EMAIL=recipient@gmail.com
```

### 2. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend server
npm run server

# Terminal 2: Test email functionality  
npm run test:email

# Terminal 3: Start full application (both frontend & backend)
npm run dev:full
```

### 3. Verify Form Submissions
1. Open the application in browser
2. Navigate to Contact, About Us, or Get Involved pages
3. Fill out and submit forms
4. Check recipient email for messages with appropriate context

## üìß EMAIL DIFFERENTIATION

The system now sends different emails based on form source:

| Page | Component | Source | Email Subject | Email Theme |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| About Us | ContactForm | "about" | "New Contact from About Us Page" | Blue theme |
| Contact | ContactFormFull | "contact" | "New Contact Form Submission" | Green theme |
| Get Involved | ContactFormFull | "get-involved" | "New Get Involved Submission" | Orange theme |

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
1. **"Failed to send email"** ‚Üí Check Gmail App Password setup
2. **Connection refused** ‚Üí Ensure backend server is running on port 5000
3. **Form not submitting** ‚Üí Check browser console and API endpoints

### Testing Commands:
- `npm run server` - Start backend
- `npm run test:email` - Test API endpoints
- `npm run dev:full` - Start complete application

## üéâ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The email functionality is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users can submit forms from any page, and the organization will receive appropriately formatted emails with context about which page the submission came from.
