### 1. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find and click on your project

   ```
5. Click **Save** after adding each variable

### 2. Wait for Deployment

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Email Sending Fails:
1. **Check Environment Variables**: Make sure they're set correctly in Vercel

4. **Test Locally First**: Run `npm run server` and `node test-email.js` to ensure it works locally

### If API Routes Don't Work:
1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**: Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Functions Tab
2. **Verify API Routes**: Make sure `/api/send-email.js` and `/api/health.js` are in the repo
3. **Check Import Syntax**: Ensure ES6 imports are used (not CommonJS)
